# TaskFlow AI Assistant

> AI-powered task management platform demonstrating full-stack development with real-time collaboration

## üöÄ Project Overview

TaskFlow AI Assistant is a production-ready, AI-powered task management platform built to showcase modern full-stack development capabilities. This project demonstrates advanced architectural patterns, AI integration, and real-time collaboration features using industry-standard technologies.

**Live Demo**: *Coming Soon - Deploying to Vercel*  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/Escobar-Luis/taskflow-ai-assistant

## üéØ Strategic Purpose

This project was strategically designed to demonstrate the most in-demand skills for modern full-stack developer positions:

- **Full-Stack Development**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and modern React patterns
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 API with intelligent caching and cost optimization  
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket-based collaboration with Observer pattern
- **Production Deployment**: Professional deployment with monitoring and performance optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - App Router with Server and Client Components
- **TypeScript** - Strict type checking and comprehensive interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **React Query** - Server state management and caching
- **Zustand** - Lightweight client state management

### Backend
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type safety with automatic API client generation
- **Prisma ORM** - Type-safe database queries with PostgreSQL
- **OpenAI API** - GPT-4 integration for intelligent task assistance
- **WebSockets** - Real-time collaboration and live updates

### Infrastructure
- **Vercel** - Serverless deployment with edge functions
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL hosting with real-time subscriptions
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Repository Pattern
Centralized data access layer with clean separation of concerns:
- `TaskRepository` - Task CRUD operations and business logic
- `CacheRepository` - AI response caching and optimization
- `UserRepository` - Authentication and user management

### Observer Pattern  
Event-driven real-time updates for collaborative features:
- `TaskObserver` - Live task updates across connected clients
- `UserPresenceObserver` - Real-time presence and collaboration indicators
- Efficient state synchronization with minimal network overhead

### Module Pattern
Organized code structure with clear boundaries:
- API modules with consistent middleware and error handling
- UI component library with reusable design patterns
- Utility modules for shared business logic
